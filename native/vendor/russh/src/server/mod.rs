//! # Writing servers
//!
//! There are two ways of accepting connections:
//! * implement the [Server](server::Server) trait and let [run_on_socket](server::Server::run_on_socket)/[run_on_address](server::Server::run_on_address) handle everything
//! * accept connections yourself and pass them to [run_stream](server::run_stream)
//!
//! In both cases, you'll first need to implement the [Handler](server::Handler) trait -
//! this is where you'll handle various events.
//!
//! Check out the following examples:
//!
//! * [Server that forwards your input to all connected clients](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/blob/main/russh/examples/echoserver.rs)
//! * [Server handing channel processing off to a library (here, `russh-sftp`)](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/blob/main/russh/examples/sftp_server.rs)
//! * Serving `ratatui` based TUI app to clients: [per-client](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/blob/main/russh/examples/ratatui_app.rs), [shared](https://github.com/warp-tech/russh/blob/main/russh/examples/ratatui_shared_app.rs)
